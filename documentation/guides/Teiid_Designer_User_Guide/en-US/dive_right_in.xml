    <para>We are going to dive right into some examples of common tasks in this section.  These examples will give you a quick 
    introduction to the capabilities that are built into Designer to assist you with common design tasks.  Specifically, we will
    introduce the following concepts:

		<listitem>
		    <para>Guides</para>
		    <para>The Guides View is a good starting point for many common modeling tasks. The view includes categorized Modeling Actions 
		    and also links to Cheat Sheets for common tasks.  The categorized Modeling Actions simply group together all of the actions
		    that you'll need to accomplish a task.  You can launch the actions directly from the Guides view, rather than hunting through
		    the various Designer menus.</para>
	    </listitem>
		<listitem>
		    <para>Cheat Sheets</para>
		    <para>The Cheat Sheets go beyond even the categorized Action Sets, and walk you step-by-step through some common tasks.
		    At each step, the data entered in the previous step is carried through the process when possible.</para>

    <para>After seeing the Guides and Cheat Sheets in action, the subsequent chapters will offer detailed explanations of the various 
    concepts and actions.

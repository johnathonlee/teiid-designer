<p class="subtitle_b16"><a name="introToRelationships"></a>Introduction
to Relationships</p>
<p> Designer includes the ability to create named relationships between
almost any two or more modeling elements.</p>
<p>The <strong>Relationship</strong> metamodel is one way to define
arbitrary associations between two or more metadata entities. Using the
<strong>Relationship</strong> metamodel, the Designer provides users
the ability to view, add, and edit associations between metadata
entities.</p>
<p>But the <strong>Generic Relationships</strong> functionality can
define relationships between metadata entities from different
metamodels. For example, it is possible to create a generalized
relationship between a Relational Column and a UML Package.</p>
<p>Users can even define their own <strong>relationship types</strong>
that constrain the numbers and types (metaclasses) of objects that can
be related. </p>
<p>Once the existing relationships are defined, the Designer provides a
number of mechanisms that will make use of those relationships. This
includes navigating to a related object, searching for relationships
based on some criteria, or diagramming the relationship of various sets
of objects</p>
<p class="subtitle_b16"><a name="createRelationships"></a>Creating
Relationships </p>
<p>To create a relationship in a diagram:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First select the source element of the
relationship.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Then Shift+Click on the second target
element. Right-click and select<strong> New Association &gt;
Relationship</strong>.</p>

 hspace="20"></p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the <strong>Create Relationship</strong>
dialog, supply a valid name for your relationship, Browse... and select
a relationship type . </p>
  <p><img style="width: 665px; height: 544px;"
 alt="Create Relationship Dialog"
 src="images/views/create-relationship-dialog.png" hspace="20"></p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click the <strong>Browse...</strong>
button adjacent to the Type field and open the <strong>Select
Relationship Type</strong> dialog and select an existing relationship
type that best describes your relationship. </p>
  <p><img style="width: 347px; height: 499px;"
 alt="Select Relationship Type"
 src="images/views/select-relationship-type-dialog.png" hspace="20"></p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Click the <strong>Browse...</strong>
button adjacent to the Location field and open the Relationship Model
Selector Dialog. If a relationship model already exists, you can select
it and click <strong>OK</strong>. If not, select a valid project or
folder and provide a valid name for a new relationship model which will
be created for you <strong>OK</strong>. </p>
  <p><img style="width: 477px; height: 436px;"
 alt="Select Relationship Model"
 src="images/views/relationship-model-selector-dialog.png" hspace="20"></p>
  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> If you wish to add additional objects to
either your source or target participants, click the <strong>Add...</strong>
button to display the Model Object Finder dialog. You can either browse
your workspace (<strong>Workspace</strong> tab) and select objects
within models, or click on the <strong>Finder</strong> tab and type in
known object names to search for specific objects by name. Click <strong>OK</strong>
to add selected objects to the participant lists. </p>

<p class="subtitle_b16"><a name="createRelationshipType"></a>Creating
your own Relationship Type </p>
<p>Modeling your specific data relationships may require you to create
your own types of relationships. Designer allows you to do that.</p>
<p>To create a new relationship type:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select an existing <strong>Relationship</strong>
model in the <a href="ModelExplorer.htm"><strong>Model Explorer</strong></a>
or a folder within the model. If a <strong>Relationship</strong> model
does not yet exist, create one. See <a
 href="ModelingYourData.htm#newModelWizard"><strong>New Model</strong></a>
wizard. </p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> RIght-click select the <strong>New Child
&gt; Relationship Type</strong> action. </p>
  <p><img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 514px; height: 320px;"
 alt="New Relationship Type"
 src="images/views/new-relationship-type-in-explorer.png" hspace="20"></p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the <strong>Create Relationship Type</strong>
dialog, supply a name for your new relationship type. </p>
  <p><img style="width: 661px; height: 700px;"
 alt="Create Relationship Type Dialog"
 src="images/views/relationship-type-dialog.png" hspace="20"> </p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select on <strong>Role A </strong>and<strong>
Role B</strong> tabs in the dialog and specify role names, <strong>Add...</strong>
any <strong>Metaclasses</strong> you wish to specifically <strong>Include</strong>
as possible participants. You can also specifically <strong>Exclude</strong>
metaclasses. </p>
  <p><img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 623px; height: 317px;"
 alt="Role A Panel"
 src="images/views/relationship-type-dialog-role-a-tab.png" hspace="20"></p>
  <p><img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 623px; height: 317px;"
 alt="Role B Panel"
 src="images/views/relationship-type-dialog-role-b-tab.png" hspace="20"></p>
  <p>You can also change role properties via the Role Properties...
button which launches a properties editor dialog.</p>
  <p><img style="width: 643px; height: 396px;" alt="Properties"
 src="images/views/relationship-type-modle-object-properties-dialog.png"
 hspace="20"> </p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Select the <strong>Inheritance</strong>
tab.</p>
  <p><img style="width: 623px; height: 317px;" alt="Inheritance Panel"
 src="images/views/relationship-type-dialog-inheritance-tab.png"
 hspace="20"></p>
  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Launch the <strong>Select Relationship
Type</strong> dialog via the <strong>Browse...</strong> button. Choose
a base relationship type that best describes your catagory of
relationship. Click <strong>OK</strong>. </p>
  <p><img style="width: 347px; height: 499px;"
 alt="Select Relationship Type"
 src="images/views/select-relationship-type-dialog.png" hspace="20"></p>
  <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Select the <strong>Properties</strong>
tab and change/set relationship type property values.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Select <strong>Finish</strong> to create
relationship type. </p>

<p class="subtitle_b16"><a name="relationshipNavigator"></a>Relationship
Navigator </p>
<p>A <strong>Relationship Navigator</strong> view provides a unique
way of viewing and navigating your relationships. It can be very useful
in understanding associations between complex and visibly unrelated
data.</p>
<p>To open the <strong>Relationship Navigator </strong>you can select
the <strong>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Relationship Navigator</strong>
action (if available) or open the<strong> Show View </strong>dialog
via <strong>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Other...</strong> and open the
Designer folder and select <strong>Relationship Navigator.</strong></p>
<p>You can also quick-launch the navigator by selecting any object in
the <a href="ModelExplorer.htm"><strong>Model Explorer </strong></a>or
a <a href="ModelEditors.htm"><strong>Model Editor</strong></a> and
right-click select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Open in
Relationship Navigator</span> action.</p>
<p>In the example presented here, the diagram below illustrates the
standard role-based relationships defined for a family.</p>
<p><img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 431px; height: 614px;"
 alt="Example Relationship Diagram"
 src="images/views/relationship-diagram-example.png" hspace="20"> </p>
<p>This action opens the <strong>Relationship Navigator</strong> in
the same panel as the <strong><a href="PropertiesView.htm">Properties</a></strong>
and <strong><a href="DescriptionView.htm">Description</a></strong>
views.</p>
<p><img style="width: 417px; height: 419px;" alt="Navigator Exmaple"
 src="images/views/relationship-navigator-example.png" hspace="20"> </p>
<p>The visible detail in the navigator is limited in order to simply
navigation. You can, however, show detailed information about the
navigation/relationship nodes by hovering your mouse and showing
tooltips.</p>
<p><img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 608px; height: 346px;"
 alt="Navigator Tooltip"
 src="images/views/relationship-navigator-tooltip.png" hspace="20"> </p>
<p>At the center of the navigator is the focused node, which represents
the base or frame of reference for the displayed navigation. In this
sample above, George has a wife, a neice and 5 sons. The relationship
diagram shown below illustrates the role based view of these same
relationships.</p>
<p>You can navigate to through your relationships by double-clicking an
end-node in one of the relationships. For instance, double-click the
Son <strong>Ron</strong> in the upper end-node and the navigator now
focuses on <strong>Ron</strong> and his relationships. You can also
right-click and select the <strong>Follow Relationships</strong>
action.</p>
<p><img style="width: 417px; height: 419px;"
 alt="Example Relationship Diagram"
 src="images/views/relationship-diagram-example-2.png" hspace="20"></p>
<p>As you navigate, a blue ball will animate the direction of the
relationship flow first too the focused object then into the end of the
relationship containing the initial focused object.</p>
<p>The navigator also provides toolbar and right-click menu actions to
perform various functions in the navigator.</p>

<p>Designing and working with data is often much easier when you can
see the information you're working with. &nbsp;The<strong>
Designer</strong>'s <strong>Preview Data </strong>feature makes this possible and
allows you to instantly preview the information described by any object,
whether it's a physical table or a virtual view. &nbsp;In other words,
you can test the views with actual data by simply selecting the table,
view, procedure or XML document. Previewing information is a fast and
easy way to sample the data. &nbsp;Of course, to run more complicated
queries like what your application likely uses, simply <a
	href="ExecuteVdbHelp.htm">execute the <strong>VDB</strong> Via DTP
<strong></strong></a> and type in any query or SQL statement.</p>
<p>After creating your models, you can test them by using the <strong>Preview
Data </strong>action, <img src="images/icons/previewData.gif" width="16"
	height="16">. By selecting a desired table object and executing
the action, the results of a simple query will be displayed in DTP's SQL
Results view. This action is accessible throughout the <strong>Designer</strong>
in various view toolbars and context menus.</p>

<p>There are two requirements for previewing your data: the selected
object must be one several previewable model object types and all source
models within the same project must be associated with a connection
profile. In order to preview the data, Designer creates a temporary data source, or connection factory
on your default Teiid server.</p>

<p>Previewable objects include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Relational table or view, including tables involving<a
		href="#previewAccessPattern"> access patterns</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="#previewRelationalProcedure">Relational procedure</a></li>
	<li><a href="#previewWSOperation">Web Service operation</a></li>
	<li>XML Document staging table</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that any virtual table, view or procedure is previewable as
long as all &quot;physical&quot; source models are associated with
connection profiles.</p>

<p>After selecting the Preview Data action, Designer will insure that all source models are associated with connection profiles
and that all required passwords are set.</p>

<p>If the model selected for preview is a source model and there is insufficient connection info for that model, the following
dialog will be displayed and the action terminated.</p>

    hspace="20"></p>
    
<p>If any of the source models in the corresponding project require a password that can't be retrieved from an existing connection
profile, the user will be queried for each missing password</p>

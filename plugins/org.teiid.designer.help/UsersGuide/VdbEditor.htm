<p>A <strong>VDB</strong>, or <span class="medium"> <a href="VdbSummary.htm">virtual database</a> is a container for components used to integrate data from multiple data sources, so that they can be accessed in a federated manner through a single, uniform API.</span> <span class="medium">A VDB contains models, which define the structural characteristics of data sources, views, and Web services.</span> The <strong>VDB Editor</strong>, provides the means to manage the contents of the VDB as well as its deployable (validation) state.</p>
<p>The <strong>VDB Editor</strong>, shown below, contains a <strong>Description</strong> area, a <strong>Models</strong> area and an &quot;<strong>Other Files</strong>&quot; area.</p>
<p><img src="images/views/VDBEditor.jpg" alt="VDB Editor" width="824" height="528"></p>
<p>Add or remove models via the buttons at the right.</p>
<p>Set individual model visibility via the &quot;Visibility&quot; checkbox for each model. This provides model-level data access security. </p>
<p>In order for a VDB to be  fully queryable the &quot;Source Name&quot;, &quot;Translator&quot; and &quot;JNDI Names&quot; must have valid values and represent deployed artifacts on your Teiid server.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>Designer</strong> runtime plugins installed, and have a <strong>Teiid</strong> server running, you can select a source model in the<strong> VDB Editor</strong> and right-click select &quot;<strong>Change Translator</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>Change JNDI Data Source</strong>&quot; which will allow you to select any applicable artifacts on your server. </p>

<p class="maintitle_b24">Model Validation </p>
<p><span class="subtitle_b16">Validation Nuts and Bolts </span></p>
<p>Validation is the process performed in Designer which verirfies that
models and VDBs within your workspace adhere to pre-determined
specifications. These specifications are typically are model-specific
and cover everything from grammar in SQL and object naming constraints,
to various properties. Some of these validation specifications can be
customed via <a href="DesignerPreferences.htm#ValidationPrefs"><strong>User
Preferences</strong></a>.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways that resources in the workspace can be
validated. The scope of a validation or "Build", can be one or more
selected projects, a working set, or the entire workspace. </p>
<p>A build will typically only operate on resources that have changed
since the last build. A <a href="#cleanBuild"><strong>clean </strong></a>build
will discard all existing built state, causing the next build to
operate on all resources within the scope of the build.</p>
<p>Builds can be done automatically (each time resources are modified),
or manually, using a menu item or keyboard shortcut. See the Related
tasks links for more details.</p>
<p><span class="subtitle_b16">Assessing your validation results </span></p>
<p class="medium">Validation errors or warnings may occur during a
modeling session in Designer due to the transitional nature of editing
models. Creating new objects that require at least one child, for
example, will usually create a validation error. If <strong><a
 href="DesignerPreferences.htm#DesignerPrefs">Models &gt; Build
Automatically</a></strong> is turned <strong>ON</strong>, then
validation will occur with each <strong>Save</strong> operation,
otherwise validation has to be performed manually via <strong>Project
&gt;<img src="images/icons/build-exec.png" height="16" width="16">
Build All, Project </strong><strong>&gt;Build Project, Project &gt;
Build Working Set or Project &gt; <a href="#cleanBuild">Clean...</a></strong>
actions.</p>

executing your VDB.</p>

<p class="medium">These problems are summarized in the<strong> Problems

<p class="medium">You can navigate to and view the specific problem
area by double-clicking the error or warning in the <strong>Problems

open in an editor and the specific problem object will be visible and
selected. </p>

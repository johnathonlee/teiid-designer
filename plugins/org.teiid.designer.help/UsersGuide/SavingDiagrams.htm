<p class="maintitle_b24">Saving Diagrams </p>
<p>The <strong> Designer</strong> allows you to save the current
diagram as an image file in either <strong>jpg</strong> or<strong> bmp
</strong>format. </p>
<p>To save a diagram to file, either right-click on diagram and choose <strong>Save
Diagram To File</strong> <img src="images/icons/tb-save-diagram.png"
 height="16" hspace="5" width="16">action or choose the associated
diagram toolbar button <img src="images/icons/tb-save-diagram.png"
 height="16" hspace="5" width="16">. This opens the <strong>Save
Diagram Image as File</strong> dialog.</p>
<p>In this dialog you can specify a folder, file name and file type.
The <strong>jpg</strong> and <strong>bmp</strong> file types are
supported.</p>
<p>If <strong>no objects</strong> in the diagram are <strong>selected</strong>,
the entire diagram (not just the visible part) will be in the saved
image.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If <strong>any of the objects</strong> in the diagram are <strong>selected</strong>,
the saved image will be as large as smallest rectangle of the diagram
that contains the selected objects.</p>

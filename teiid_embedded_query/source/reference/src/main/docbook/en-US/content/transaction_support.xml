		Teiid utilizes XA transactions for both participating in global
		transactions and for demarcating its own local and command scoped
		transactions.
		<ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/jbosstm/">JBoss Transactions</ulink>
		is used by Teiid as its internal transaction manager. See

		<para>The concept of command safety with respect to a transaction
			is determined by Teiid based upon command type and available
			metadata. Whenever any INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or EXECUTE (with
			update count greater than 0) command is detected and the success or
			failure of that command is not the same as the user level command,
			then the command is deemed unsafe without a transaction.</para>
		<para>The update count may be set on dynamic SQL as part of the
			command and on all other procedures as part of the procedure metadata
			in the model.</para>

	<sect1 id="updating_model_count">
		<title>Updating Model Count</title>
		<para>The term "updating model count" refers to the number of times
			any model is updated during the execution of a command. It is used to
			determine whether a transaction, of any scope, is required to safely
			execute the command.</para>

		<para> By default Teiid will calculate the updating model count for
			a user query (which may be composed of many subcommands) given the
			above table. Thus a command with a single update as a subcommand may
			still require a transaction if the update is not tied to the success
			of the command.</para>
		<para>
			Explicit values for updating model count may be set using Teiid
			Designer and directly in the
			<link linkend="dynamic_sql">dynamic SQL command</link>

				<para>The transaction scopes above map to these JDBC modes:
				</para>
				<listitem>
					<para>Command - Connection autoCommit property set to true.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Local - Connection autoCommit property set to false. The
						transaction is committed by setting autoCommit to true or calling
						<function>java.sql.Connection.commit
						</function>
						. The transaction can be rolled back by a call to
						<function>java.sql.Connection.rollback
						</function>
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Global - the XAResource interface provided by an XAConnection is
						used to control the transaction. Note that XAConnections are
						available only if Teiid is consumed through its XADataSource,
						<classname>com.metamatrix.jdbc.MMDataSource
						</classname>
						. JEE containers or data access APIs typically control XA
						transactions on behalf of application code.

			<title>J2EE Usage Models</title>
			<itemizedlist>
				<para>J2EE provides three ways to manage transactions for beans:
				</para>
				<listitem>
					<para>Client-controlled – the client of a bean
						begins and ends a transaction explicitly.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Bean-managed – the bean itself begins and ends a
						transaction explicitly.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Container-managed – the app server container
						begins and ends a transaction automatically.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>In any of these cases, transactions may be either local or XA
				transactions, depending on how the code and descriptors are written.
				Some kinds of beans (stateful session beans and entity beans) are
				not required by the spec to support non-transactional sources,
				although the spec does allow an app server to optionally support
				this with the caution that this is not portable or predictable.
				Generally speaking, to support most typical EJB activities in a
				portable fashion requires some kind of transaction support.</para>

		<title>Limitations and Workarounds</title>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>The client setting of transaction isolation level is not
					used. The transaction isolation level can be set on each XA
					connector, however this isolation level is fixed and cannot be
					changed at runtime for specific connections/commands.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Since the client transaction isolation level is not used,
					Teiid internally assumes a level of READ_COMMITTED. This implies
					that explicit transactions are not required for user level commands
					performing multiple reads.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Temporary tables are not transactional. For example,
					a global temporary table will retain all inserts performed during a
					local transaction that was rolled back.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Connectors may be set to immutable to prevent their
					participation in transactions. This is useful in situations where
					update commands are being issued against a source that lacks XA
					transaction capabilities.</para>

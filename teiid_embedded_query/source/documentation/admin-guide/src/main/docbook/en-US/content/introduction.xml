    <title>Introduction to MMAdmin</title>
    <para>
      MMAdmin is a script based programing environment that enables user to access, monitor and control Teiid
      Server and MMQuery environments. This tool is built using programming language called BeanShell (
      <ulink url="http://beanshell.org/">http://beanshell.org</ulink>
      ). MMAdmin can be used in ad-hoc scripting, or to run pre-defined scripts. It is not a graphical tool; it's a
      command line driven environment.

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>It is a fully functional programming environment with resource flow control and exception
          management. Under the covers it is a fully functional Java programming environment.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>It is an Administrative tool. The user can connect to a running Teiid Server and invoke any of
          the Admin API methods, such as "addVDB" or "stopConnector", to control Teiid System just like using
          Console. Since, this is script driven, these tasks can be automated and re-run at a later time.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>It is a data access tool. The user can connect to a VDB, issue any SQL commands, and view the
          results of the query.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>It is a migration tool. This can be used to develop scripts like moving the Virtual Databases
          (VDB), Connector Bindings, and Configuration from one development environment to another. This will
          enable users to test and automate their migration scripts before production deployments.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          It is a testing tool. The JUnit (
          <ulink url="http://junit.org/">http://junit.org</ulink>
          ) test framework is built into it. User can write regression tests for checking system health, or data
          integrity that can be used to validate a system functionality automatically instead of manual
          verification by QA personnel.

      <title>Where can you find MMAdmin?</title>
      Where can you find MMAdmin
      <para>MMAdmin is bundled with the Teiid under “tools” package. Download and unzip this
        file to any directory using WinZip or tar command. Once you have unzipped the file, in root directory
        you will find “mmadmin” executable script to invoke the tool.</para>
      <para>Windows: Double click or execute "mmadmin.cmd"</para>
      <para>*nix: Execute the "mmadmin" script</para>
      <para>to invoke MMAdmin. This will initialize the shell and present you with a prompt:</para>
      <programlisting><![CDATA[      
          mmadmin $
      ]]></programlisting>       
      <para>Note:  JDBC client API jar files are required on the same machine in order to successfully invoke
        MMAdmin. Usually these jar files are found in “Server” or “Console” installation directories under “client”
        directory.</para>

/**
 * <p>This is a simple utility class to help keep password values from being
 * printed out, primarily from java.util.Properties object, into
 * MetaMatrix log files.  This is <i>not</i> a robust security solution
 * for protecting passwords, and is only good insofar as we get all
 * other code to use this when necessary.  When passwords are properly
 * encrypted in the database, this class will be no longer necessary.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class can be used in one of two ways.  First, a Properties object
 * can be wrapped in an instance of this class - the properties object,
 * wrapped in this instance, can then be safely sent to LogManager to be
 * logged, or can otherwise be printed out.  This instance will basically
 * duplicate the toString() method of a normal Properties object, but will
 * obfuscate any property values whose names end in any of the well-known
 * {@link #PASSWORD_PROP_SUFFIXES password property suffixes}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The second way is to just use this class's static
 * {@link #doesNameEndWithPasswordSuffix doesNameEndWithPasswordSuffix}
 * utility method by hand, passing in a String property name to
 * see if it ends with any of the well-known
 * {@link #PASSWORD_PROP_SUFFIXES password property suffixes}.</p>

This kit contains tool set required to build a "Custom Connector" for Teiid System. 
Please check "Connector Developer's Guide" for more information on how to write a Custom
Connector.

Please note that you can use API classes from "teiid-connector-api-{VERSION}.jar" in this directory to build your Custom 
Connector. The jar files from the "lib" directory are provided only for unit testing and running the cdk tool, the
class files from these libraries should not be used to develop your connector code, as they will not be supported 
during runtime.

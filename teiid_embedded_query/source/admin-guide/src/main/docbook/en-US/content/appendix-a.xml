      <question>
        <para>What is different between "connect(&lt;url&gt;)" method and "connectAsAdmin()"?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>Connect connects to the Teiid system using a VDB name, so you should be able to run any SQL command which is based on that VDB along with Admin method calls. If you use "connectAsAdmin" then you can run all the admin calls but you can not run any SQL commands, and you do not need a VDB to connect to the Teiid system.</para>

      <question>
        <para>How to turn OFF interactive mode? How can I capture results to a file?</para>

        ]]></programlisting>    
        <para>this will turn off the interactive features like spitting the results to console. This is good way to capture
        the results of the executed query. Use <emphasis>printResults(File)</emphasis> method to capture the previously executed
        SQL command's results to the file handle supplied</para>

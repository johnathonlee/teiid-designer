# The Exec Connector allows for the defining of specific commands that
# are not allowed to be executed.  Therefore, the defined commands
# below represent the exclusion list the connector will use to determine
# if a submitted command is available for execution.

# To use an exclusion list, add the property file to the Extension Modules
# via the console.   Then edit the exec connector binding property - exclusionFile
# and set it to the name given to the extension module.

# Processing Notes:
# - the case of the command doesn't matter, the validation is case insensitive
# - if the exclusion command is found anywhere in the submitted
#   command, the whole command will not be executed.
exc1=rm
exc2=donotrun

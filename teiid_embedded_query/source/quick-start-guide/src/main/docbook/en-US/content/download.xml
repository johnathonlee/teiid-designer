    You need to download the binaries for
    <ulink url="http://teiid.org/Download.html">Teiid</ulink>
    . Note that there are three different artifacts are available for download.
  </para>
  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Teiid Source - contains all the source code for all modules</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Teiid Adminshell - contains the admin client binary code</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Teiid Kit - contains only required modules and their required 3rd party
        dependencies</para>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
  <para>
    For this Quick Start, download the
    <emphasis>Teiid Kit</emphasis>
    and extract this tar/zip file to a directory you can access.
  </para>
  <para>In the expanded directory, you will find "client/teiid-${version}-client.jar", which is the main client binary jar
    file for Teiid, and the "lib" and "extension" directories containing binaries either directly or indirectly
    required to execute Teiid. Later sections describe installing these artifacts.</para>
  <note>
    <para>Teiid requires <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads">Java 6</ulink> to run.
    </para>
  	<para>
      Access to physical data sources such as Oracle, MS-SQL Server, DB2, and Sybase through Teiid relies upon
      the user supplying their own JDBC drivers in the deployment. Teiid
      has been tested extensively with
      <ulink url="http://www.datadirect.com">DataDirect</ulink>
       If you have access to these JDBC drivers, we recommend their use.
    </para>
    <!-- 
    <para>Free open source software JDBC drivers for MySQL, Postgres,and Derby are included in the "lib" folder as the LGPL
      license permits them to be included with the Teiid kit.</para>

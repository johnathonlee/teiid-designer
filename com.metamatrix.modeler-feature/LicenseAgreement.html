<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Software License Agreement</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The following are the terms and 
  conditions under which Varsity Gateway LLC ("MetaMatrix") licenses its Software 
  to Licensee. "Software" shall mean those computer programs in object code and 
  associated documentation owned and marketed by MetaMatrix. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. The license granted to Licensee 
  hereunder is a nontransferable, non-exclusive right to use the MetaMatrix Software 
  for Licensee's own internal use subject to the following limitations specified 
  in the related Purchase Order issued by Licensee to MetaMatrix or its authorized 
  reseller; 1) limited to use on only the number of central processing units ("CPUs") 
  identified in the Purchase Order and 2) limited to the number of Data Sources 
  specified in the Purchase Order. "Data Source" shall mean a discrete collection 
  of data, including, but not limited to, relational databases, text files, data 
  streams, legacy database systems, web services, or other enterprise data base 
  information systems, maintained in a single electronic computer file that is 
  connected to and accessed by the Software. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. The MetaMatrix Software is licensed, 
  not sold to Licensee. Except as specifically licensed to Licensee hereunder, 
  MetaMatrix retains all right, title and interest, including all intellectual 
  property rights, in and to the MetaMatrix Software. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. The MetaMatrix Software may only 
  be used for, by and on behalf of Licensee, by employees of Licensee or consultants 
  working for Licensee under Licensee's supervision. Licensee may not provide 
  direct or indirect electronic access to the MetaMatrix Software to any other 
  party. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. Upon MetaMatrix's request, an 
  authorized officer of Licensee shall represent to MetaMatrix in writing within 
  10 days of such request, that except for a backup copy of the MetaMatrix Software, 
  the MetaMatrix Software has been installed and operative only on the designated 
  number of CPU(s). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. Licensee's rights to use the MetaMatrix 
  Software may not be assigned, sublicensed, or otherwise transferred voluntarily, 
  by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of MetaMatrix, 
  and any such prohibited assignment, sublicense and/or transfer shall be null 
  and void. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. Upon termination of this Agreement, 
  Licensee shall deliver to MetaMatrix all copies of the MetaMatrix Software furnished 
  then in its possession or under its control and/or certify that those copies 
  not so returned have been destroyed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. Licensee acknowledges that the 
  MetaMatrix Software is a commercially valuable proprietary product and trade 
  secret of MetaMatrix, and that the MetaMatrix Software (including, but not limited 
  to the MetaMatrix Software's design, programming techniques, algorithms and 
  codes) is regarded by MetaMatrix as secret and confidential. Licensee agrees 
  not to disclose any portion of the MetaMatrix Software to unauthorized persons, 
  whether or not such portion is or may be validly copyrighted or patented. Licensee 
  shall treat all proprietary information and Software of MetaMatrix as confidential 
  and shall safeguard it to the same extent that the Licensee safeguards its own 
  confidential information but in any event in at least a reasonably prudent manner. 
  Licensee agrees to use its best efforts to ensure that all those persons having 
  access to the MetaMatrix Software under this Agreement shall observe and perform 
  this non-disclosure covenant. Licensee shall hold MetaMatrix and its suppliers 
  harmless against any loss, cost, expense, claim or liability resulting from 
  Licensee's breach of this non-disclosure obligation. Licensee further acknowledges 
  that in the event of an actual or threatened violation of the foregoing provision, 
  MetaMatrix may obtain remedies at law and in equity (including injunctive relief). 
  The terms of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8. Subject to a current annual support 
  contract being place and payment of any applicable support fees by Licensee, 
  MetaMatrix agrees to provide support and software upgrades as described in such 
  support contract. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9. Either party shall have the right 
  to terminate this Agreement in the event of any material breach of the Agreement 
  by the other party provided that the breaching party has not cured such breach 
  within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of such breach from the 
  non-breaching party. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10. MetaMatrix makes no representations 
  as to any third party Software including but not limited to computer hardware, 
  software, and data. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO LIABILITY THAT
 CANNOT BE WAIVED UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW, INCLUDING STATE AND FEDERAL 
 SECURITIES LAWS, IN NO EVENT SHALL METAMATRIX HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO LICENSEE
 OR TO OTHERS FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF 
 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE LIABILITY OF METAMATRIX TO LICENSEE 
 HEREUNDER FOR DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, SHALL BE LIMITED TO 
 DIRECT DAMAGES AND SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID BY LICENSEE TO 
 METAMATRIX PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY 
 PRECEDING THE FIRST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY; AND NO ACTION, REGARDLESS OF 
 FORM, ARISING FROM OR PERTAINING TO ANY OF THE LICENSED METAMATRIX SOFTWARE 
 PROVIDED HEREUNDER MAY BE BROUGHT BY LICENSEE MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH 
 ACTION HAS ACCRUED. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12. MetaMatrix shall not be liable 
  for delays in performance of its duties due to causes beyond its reasonable 
  control, including, but not limited to, Acts of God, strikes or inability to 
  obtain labor or materials on time. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13. No waiver of any breach of any 
  provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent 
  or subsequent breach of any other provisions hereof and no waiver shall be effective 
  unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative. If any provision 
  of this Agreement shall be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, such provision 
  shall be severed and the balance of the Agreement shall continue in full force 
  and effect. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14. All notices which either party 
  is required to give shall be given by certified or registered mail. Such notices

  the State of New York, USA and shall be governed by the laws of the State of 
  New York, USA. All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be 
  submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts of competent 
  jurisdiction located in Raleigh, North Carolina, and each party irrevocably consents 
  to such personal jurisdiction and waives all objections to this venue. If any action 
  or proceeding is brought in connection with the Agreement, the prevailing party 
  therein shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorneys' fees in 
  addition to whatever other remedies to which it may otherwise be entitled. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16. This Agreement supersedes in 
  full all prior discussions and agreements between the parties relating to the 
  MetaMatrix Software, and may be modified or supplemented only by a written document 
  signed by an authorized representative of each party. The foregoing notwithstanding, 
  the preprinted terms and conditions of any purchase order or other ordering 
  document issued by the Licensee in connection with this Agreement which are 
  in addition to or inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement 
  shall not be binding on MetaMatrix and shall not be deemed to modify this Agreement.
